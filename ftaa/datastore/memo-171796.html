<p>
To: FTAA Analysts and Historians
</p>
<p>
From: Director’s Advisory Council
</p>
<p>
Subject: Call for Proposals - Potential Opportunities for Temporal Incursion
</p>
<p>
Following the events of Spring 1992, the FTAA Director’s Advisory Council has decided to take a more active role in engagement and intervention within temporal eras upstream of the present. The exhortations within the messages from our descendants downstream have been taken seriously; the FTAA is committed to using our technological tools and personnel to improve the lives of eras upstream of our own.
</p><p>
These incursions will undoubtedly need to be undertaken with great care. As a result, the Advisory Council is leaning on the field to offer initial proposals for potential incursion events. These proposals should include a detailed background statement on the historical era in question, options for intervention, and the potential ripple effects on downstream eras.
</p><p>
Please see your local office’s Incursion Planning Officer for examples of the format and content of incursion proposals. These proposals will be accepted on a rolling basis, and may be submitted to the IPO, who will forward them to the DAC for review and potential implementation.
</p><p>
Note that FTAA Policy #AHEH38-45 applies to these proposals - please do not submit proposals which attempt to prevent or may unintentionally invert the Second World War or impact its broad narrative flow in drastic ways.
</p><p>
The DAC thanks you all in advance for your thoughtful submissions to make the past a better place.
