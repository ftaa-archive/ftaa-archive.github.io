Subject: Final Unauthorized Incursion Findings - 17 September 1992
</p>
<p>
<br/>
The Director's Severe Incident Review Team has concluded its investigation of the rogue incursion event initiated on 17 September 1992 by a former employee. This unauthorized use of agency equipment and breach of security protocols has thrown light on a number of issues facing our agency moving forward.</p><p>Beyond security concerns, the review team's conclusions impact the operations of both Paradox Avoidance and Chronolographic Ethics in the following key ways:</p><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Employee Access to Research Materials</b><br/><br/>Finding: One crucial misstep in this incident occurred by allowing open access to research and historical materials with no oversight or review. This allowed for the employee to independently research and plan an incursion using agency resources.<br/><br/>Recommendation: All use of research and historical materials will be reviewed monthly by a review committee for access outside of assigned projects and periods of focus. In addition, new algorithmic search functions will be added to computerized cataloging systems to flag potentially troublesome access to materials for immediate emergency review.</li><br/>

<li><b>Employee Access to Restricted Areas</b><br/><br/>Finding: Access to critical areas was offered too willingly to the rogue employee. By allowing employee to utilize a second, alternate office space within the secure Site R temporal research facility, the rogue element was able to easily bypass critical security safeguards to access supercollider control.<br/><br/>
Recommendation: All security clearances and facility access for Paradox Avoidance and Chronolographic Ethics staff will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. This review process will investigate both the necessity of allowing each employee access to secure facilities and the trustworthiness of employees. In addition, access to secure facilities will no longer automatically be granted along with position, instead operating on an individual-by-individual basis.</li><br/>

<li><b>Improved Oversight of Official Communication Systems</b><br/><br/>Finding: Subsequent search of employee's workspace and computer workstation revealed extensive notes and plans for rogue incursion event. This included communication with other FTAA staff who may or may not have been aware of the employee's intentions.<br/><br/>
Recommendation: The agency will more stringently enforce its policy of surveillance of critical systems. A reminder will be sent to all employees that computer systems, including all related equipment, networks, and network devices are provided by the Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority in accordance with the agency policy for official use. All agency computer systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes, including but not limited to, ensuring that use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability and operational security. Any information on agency computer systems may be examined, recorded, copied and used for authorized purposes at any time. Evidence of an employee's use, authorized or unauthorized, collected during monitoring may be used for civil, criminal, administrative, or other adverse action. Unauthorized or illegal use may subject employees to prosecution.</li><br/></ul>
