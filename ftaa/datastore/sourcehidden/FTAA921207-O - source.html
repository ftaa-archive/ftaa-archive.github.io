Dear New Employee,</p><p>
I am pleased to welcome you to the Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority, our nation’s leading defenders of temporal stability and champions of American chronographic technology. The career you are embarking on with our organization will now doubt be a challenging and rewarding one. Our agency fulfills many key functions for the American people. You are now part of that crucial work to help keep Americans safe.</p><p>
You are now joining a long line of dedicated public servants - stretching back to the agency’s roots in a multi-agency cooperating agreement in 1967. Thanks to investment and foresight of our leadership, the FTAA has grown into a vibrant and meaningful agency of the Department of Commerce. With partners in a variety of Federal Departments, our agency works in concert to better serve the people of the United States.</p><p>
You will be working with one of the greatest teams of scientists, historians, and strategic minds ever assembled at the National Chronographic Laboratory and Research Center, located on the grounds of Fort Ritchie. No matter your role with the FTAA, your work helps produce cutting edge scholarship and keep Americans safe.</p><p>
I am thrilled to be able to call you a colleague. I look forward to the important work we will all undertake together.</p><p>

<h3>Welcome to the FTAA</h3>
Our job is to make sure you are setting foot on solid ground. This New Employee Resource Guide contains high-level information to ensure you are set up for success. Some of these items are specific to your assigned facility, some are general to our agency. If you have questions about an item, you can talk to your Supervisor, Onboarding Point of Contact (OPOC), or other team member. </p><p>
<h3>Your Onboarding Point of Contact (OPOC)</h3>
As a new employee, an OPOC will be assigned to you. This OPOC will help you during your first year of employment by offering advice and guidance and helping to foster and promote your skills and professional development. Your OPOC knows the ropes within the Organization, they know what actions will ensure success in achieving the Agency mission. They are a source of advice and encouragement who can succeed in steering you in the right direction. Their role is to create a comfortable, more informal environment in which you can ask and receive information about the FTAA’s culture and norms, including those everyday procedures and policies, written and unwritten, that help to explain how things really work.</p><p>
<h3>Oath of Office</h3>
On your first day as a member of the FTAA, you will be administered the Oath of Office by your OPOC or supervisor. This oath is sworn by every member of the Agency and Federal Employee:</p><p>

I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.</p><p>
In addition, you will be asked to swear an oath of allegiance to our temporal era:</p><p>
I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a native or naturalized citizen of the current temporal era, and I hold no allegiance to another time - before or after - the current moment.</p><p>
<h3>Our History</h3>
The FTAA began as a multi-agency cooperating agreement initiated by the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology). Initially, this partnership consisted of cooperating elements of the FBI, DOD, and AEC (now Department of Energy).</p><p>
Originally headquartered at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Lawrence, CA, NIST established an east coast research hub at their Gaithersburg, MD campus in 1971. This site became the National Chronographic Laboratory and Research Center and hub of FTAA operations in 1973.</p><p>
In cooperation with the Department of Defense, the NCLRC was moved to its present campus on the grounds of Fort Ritchie, Maryland in July 1983. Since then, the FTAA has served a vital role in maintaining temporal stability, detecting anomalous activity, and overseeing chronographic operations.</p><p>
<h3>Your New Workplace</h3>
The National Chronographic Laboratory and Research Center at Fort Ritchie (often called the FTAA Campus or “Ritchie” by employees) houses key functions from every office and functional area of the agency. Your OPOC will take you on a tour of the facility during your initial week of employment. This tour should include not only your workspace, but also the many resources available to you across the campus.</p><p>
The FTAA operates from a number of buildings near the core of Fort Ritchie. These buildings - many dating to the camp’s origins as a National Guard training facility - offer a historic space to accomplish our work. The campus is largely confined to a few blocks are. This map will assist in navigating your new workplace.</p><p>

<h3>New Employee Checklist</h3>
During your first day of work, your OPOC will review your “New Employee Checklist” document and help you plan your first week of work. This document will help you to complete the steps to obtain proper clearances, access to critical infrastructure, and establish your payroll and accounting documentation. This checklist will be your guide to your new journey as an employee of the FTAA. Your OPOC has access to the most recently updated checklist.</p><p>
From everyone in the FTAA’s Office of Human Resources, we wish you a hearty welcome to the FTAA and Fort Ritchie!</p><p>
