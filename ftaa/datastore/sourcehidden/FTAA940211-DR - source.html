<br/>
At 4:06:12 am local time, ADC personnel at Raven Rock detected an unknown anomalous temporal energy spike located at approximately 54째 50' 50" North, 83째 6' 30" East. This energy spike is indicative of a medium scale incursion. ADC is unable to discern whether this incursion is inbound to or outbound from the current era.</p><p>
Based on the dataset collected, ADC is certain of the location of the energy spike within approximately a 1/2 mile radius of the indicated geolocation. Energy spike time is accurate within a 2 second window of certainty.</p><p>
In concert with Temporal Surveillance, ADC will continue to analyze the data in coming days to better understand the nature of the energy spike and its implications on temporal stability.</p><p>
