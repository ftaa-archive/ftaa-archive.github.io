<p>
From: Emmet Riddle, Director

<p>
Subject: Document Briefing Request
</p>
<p>
<br/>
Chief Alice,</p><p>
This message is in response to your request to present a special briefing to the Director's Leadership Council at our monthly meeting on February 22nd. I am denying your request to place this item on our monthly agenda.</p><p>
I cannot see the benefit of briefing the entirety of the leadership council on this set of documents, nor the pertinence of documents from a decade ago to our work at the present moment. Surely the issues dealt with in these documents and materials you allege to have uncovered have long passed their usefulness to the pressing issues facing our agency.</p><p>
I understand your frustration at what you perceive as our agency's "lack of vociferous ethical review" of actions and decisions. However, I can assure you that both myself and your fellow members of the Leadership Council are deeply committed to ensuring that our agency's decisions are both ethically motivated and intentionally crafted.</p><p>
In light of this commitment to ethics, I would like to remind you that none in our agency - from our front line staff up to members of my leadership council - are beyond reproach for actions they take which endanger our agency or the stability of the timeline. We have had issues with this in the past specifically with a member of the leadership council and I would hate to have similar issues again.</p><p>
If you would like to discuss this matter further, you may contact my secretary to arrange a one on one meeting. Otherwise, I consider the issue of these documents and their supposed ethical implications closed.</p><p>
[SIGNED]</p><p>
