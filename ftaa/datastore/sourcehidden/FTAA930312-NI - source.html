<p>
Non-Intervention Policy Announce
</p>
<p>
To: All FTAA Employees & Staff
</p>
<p>
From: Emmet Riddle, Director
</p>
<p>
Subject: Summary of New Non-Intervention Policy
</p>
<p>
<br/>
The senior leadership team is proud to announce the release of a new policy of non-intervention for the FTAA. Based on a draft submitted by the Chronolographic Ethics department, your leadership team has been hard at work creating this new policy which will guide our actions as an agency and as individuals in the work we are undertaking.p><p>
The full policy is available in printed format and will be issued to each office and department upon receipt from the GPO. In advance of this release, the leadership team would like to share some of the key new policies and guidelines outlined therein:</p><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Incursion Control Protocols</b> - The non-intervention policy does not mean an end to the FTAA's crucial work in undertaking physical incursion missions to eras upstream of our current time. Instead, we will be placing strict guidelines and procedures on all incursion missions. Where appropriate, remote observation equipment may be used to undertake operations in alternate time periods. However, where manned mission are required they will now be undertaken with strict oversight by the Temporal Observation Post at Site R. Staff and officers in this post now have increased authority to recall or terminate any mission at the first sign of unintended temporal alteration or disruption.</li>
<li><b>Temporal Observation Expansion</b> - The Temporal Surveillance division will double the on-duty staff within the Site R Temporal Observation Post at all times effective immediately, from two to four. This will help maintain greater vigilance and awareness of small alterations to the timestream by keeping more staff within the quartzite-shielded bunker. In addition, Temporal Surveillance will continue searching for a suitable quartzite outcropping to locate a failsafe alternate Temporal Observation Post.</li>
<li><b>Cooperating Agreements</b> - The new temporal non-intervention policy will seek to limit impacts on cooperating agreements the FTAA has formed with Federal and non-Federal entities. Special operating parameters and procedures are now in development for joint operations which the FTAA may undertake with our partners in the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and private contractors.</li>
<li><b>Continuation of Temporal Embassy Program</b> - In cooperation with the Department of State, Cross-Temporal Relations will continue the program of maintaining three upstream embassy operations. These burgeoning relationships have proven fruitful and meaningful as a means of exchange of not only goods, but ideas and information. New protocols will be put in place to further review all interactions and engagement with individuals within these embassy operations nattive to alternate eras.</li>
<li><b>End-of-Life Extraction</b> - When possible, all extraction of native resources or individuals from eras upstream of the current time will be undertaken using a strict end-of-life protocol. All resources or individuals removed from their own era will be extracted at a moment when their presence will no longer have an impact on the timeline, as determined by Paradox Avoidance prior to mission initiation. Exceptions to this new operating parameter may only be made with approval from the Director's office.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>By shifting how we operate as an agency, we will better be able to serve the American people safely and with as little impact on their daily lives as possible. Your leadership team is committed to a safe and responsible temporal incursion program, free from widespread paradoxes or sustained causal disruption. With your help, we can keep the present safe by being careful in the past.<p><p>
