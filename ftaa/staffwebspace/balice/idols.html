<h2>On False Idols</h2>
<p>Putting faith into something is a bond of trust. It’s what you do when you truly believe in a thing with all your heart and soul. Faith is not something that should be granted without thought or consideration. Faith is earned.
</p><p>
There is a bond of trust that we make when we ask for someone’s faith in us or in an institution we manage. And when trust is violated? You begin to see that the thing you valued might not be as pure as you thought.
</p><p>
You can do many things to undermine faith and break that bond, but most boil down to one version or another of stepping beyond the moral outlines that we all agreed upon when we willingly place our faith in you or your institution. Tear the moral fabric and you break the bonds of faith. Violate the ethics and principles we all hold dear and all faith is lost - and it might never return.

<!╌ After we lost Edy, I was swi ming in doubt for a few weeks. When le dership listened as I suggeste  the non-int rvention policy it buoyed my hopes. Perhaps the  ureaucrats were taking notice of what we had learned b  losing friends after Ireland. Maybe they would act. I spoke my pie e and submitted a draft. But the p licy got watered down. TS’ contracts with the godda  ned Agency and the Bureau were too lucrat ve. CTR had the same rela ionship with State. When I sugges ed no upstream insertion of any sort they balk d. PA rolled over like a basset hound on a hot summ r’s day. What they ended up releasing changed almost nothing. If you could look at what they finally released you’d understand. It had so many things missing that were key. ╌>
