<h2>On Serendipity (in an Era of Time Travel)</h2>
<p>You would think we could know everything by now. We have access to the whole of time. We can peer into the past or take a look at the future. And yet, there are still moments to be surprised.
</p><p>
It’s not simply because some information is locked away, either. No. It’s amazing how easily we just ignore things sitting right in front of us. The documents or objects have been sitting there staring in our faces all along and no one ever paid attention. Until suddenly someone does.
</p><p>
It will never cease to strike me. When we find a new fact, a new document, a new piece of evidence that just opens up new understanding.
</p><p>
We should know everything. But somehow we still don’t. And sometimes that small piece of evidence lands in your lap at the right moment.
</p>
<!╌ This is a big step. I’ve always considered myself an ethical person. It’s been my stock and trade afterall. That’s meant following the rules and doing what’s right. And until now, those two have aligned relatively closely. Now I’m not so sure. The organization is broken. It might be broken beyond repair. Maybe it’s been broken since the start, if this new set of documents is saying what I think it is. I prepared a special briefing for the rest of leadership and was brushed off. Scolded even. I handed them the key; it was maligned. But the truth must get out. I just can’t quite decide how. ╌>
