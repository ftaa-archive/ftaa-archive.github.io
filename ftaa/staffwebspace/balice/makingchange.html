<h2>On Making Change</h2>
<p>There are many of my colleagues who argue that our mission is change. The agency, they underscore, is presupposed on it. We alter things, tinker with them, make them better.
</p><p>
On one level, I don’t disagree. We gather information and resources. We make excursions to foreign lands - places L. P. Hartley wasn’t entirely wrong about with his maxim. And with what we learn, we change.
</p><p>
I think that word is where I differ with my colleagues. We both believe in changing because of what we see when we look at different moments in time. But what do you change?
</p><p>
For me, it’s about changing your actions. We learn from the things we observe and use them to inform how we move forward. We take the stories we retrieve from a poorly understood and fragmentary past, then resolve to learn from them. We decide to change and make different mistakes than those made by those who came before us. Or even those we made ourselves.
</p><p>
But to my colleagues? Change means something different. More concrete. More invasive. More dangerous. Less meaningful. Less calculated. Less ethical.
</p><p>
I used to be like them. That might be the most frightening idea, too<a href="imgs/fragment.jpg" target="_blank">.</a>

<!╌ What can change look like in reality? I know what it shouldn’t look like: a broken San Francisco street lined with the charred ruins of poorly made decisions and misguided attempts at repairing something irreparable. It’s not meddling. But I think that meddling is why we’re here. Why this place was created. How the agency was perfected. I thought the meddling was a small tool, just something that sat alongside the observation and the cataloging. I thought incursion was a tool among tools. Now I think I see - it was always the end in and of itself. We are all time meddlers, starting from the top on down. I’m not absolved of the sin. But maybe I can start to atone. The recent rogue temporal disruption has everyone worried - so much so they won’t let most of the agency know where it happened. More secrets is their answer, of course. We were alone until this point. But is there a time race, now? Are other people meddling? Threatening the agency’s precious power and control? Do we fear what we’ve always championed now? The key is that one word which describes our agency’s stock and trade, I guess. ╌>
