<h2>On a Colleague Found and Lost: Dr. Edy Titus</h2>
<p>This page serves as a memorial of sorts. It is a space to remember my friend and colleague Dr. Edith “Edy” Titus. She died a year ago. Or two lifetimes ago. It’s complicated.
</p><p>
Deputy Chief of Paradox Avoidance at the time of her death, Edith was a mentor and guiding light in my career. She was the first kind face that met me when I arrived at the agency in 1983. She helped me feel at home in this new landscape of government bureaucracy.
</p><p>
Edy was a stalwart advocate for humanity. A brilliant physicist, Edy plowed new ground for the agency around temporal causality and calculation of the probability of anomalies escalating to paradox level.
</p><p>
An advisor and friend, Edy and I collaborated on work both inside the agency and beyond. Without her encouragement, I never would have become the amateur cryptographer I am today. Together we founded the BRSCS, though Edy had been dabbling in codes and ciphers for decades already.
</p><p>
Edy Titus was a warm friend, a good person, and a great influence. She is deeply missed.
</p>
<!╌ It only seems fitting to hide this message inside “code” because of my and Edy’s shared passion for cryptography. She would have loved HTML’s simplicity. If only she hadn’t sacrificed herself before I began exploring these standards that Berners-Lee is working on. She’d be thrilled with these picturesque ways we can hide information inside other things and send it zipping across the globe. ╌>
