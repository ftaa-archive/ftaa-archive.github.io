<h2>On Deinceps Offensionis</h2>
<p>I don’t have a family crest. I have been trying to convince my husband we should design our own. He just ribs me that I should have taken his last name because his ancestors have a crest AND a tartan.
</p><p>
If I did have a family crest, it would have the motto “Deinceps Offensionis.” I flunked Latin, so I’m not sure of the declension on that one. I think it would translate to “Forward Stumbling.”
</p><p>
Failing forward has been a hallmark of my life. I try to give myself the grace to make mistakes. As an historian - a professional mistake-finder, of sorts - it’s something I can embrace. Groping at the darkness ahead of me and quietly trying to discover where to go next can be exhilarating.

<!╌ I know I can’t stay silent for much longer. The damage they’re going to do to our mission and our purpose in the name of efficiency and “return on investment” is going to be immense. But I don’t know how I can stopper the wound. The best I can do right now is keep leaking these small bits of information. I’m not lost to the fact that leaking a document on “Improper Use of Research” is a bit on the nose. But I’m not leaking it - they asked for it to be put on the server. I’m just letting you know how to unlock it. The translation is the key. ╌>
