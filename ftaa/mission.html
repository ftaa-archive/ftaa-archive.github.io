<h3>The Mission of the FTAA</h3>
<p>
The mission of the Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority is defined in the FTAA 
Authorization Act of 1967 as follows:
</p><p>
<i>The Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority studies, monitors, and assists in 
responding to paradoxes to protect and defend the interests of the American 
people. The FTAA cooperates with partners to develop understanding of other 
eras and defend the current temporal era.</i>

<h3>Major Events in the History of the FTAA</h3>
<p><ul>
<li><b>1967</b> - Congress authorizes the FTAA to be formed in a multi-agency 
cooperating agreement between National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), the Atomic 
Energy Commission, the Department of Defense, and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory 
(now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). The first FTAA offices are 
established on the campus of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in California.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1971</b> - National Bureau of Standards establishes an East Coast research 
hub on their Gaithersburg, MD campus. President Richard M. Nixon attends the 
groundbreaking of the main research facility building. This facility eventually 
becomes known as the National Chronographic Laboratory and Research Center (CLARC).
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1983</b> - In a strengthened partnership with Department of Defense, the 
National Bureau 
of Standards moves the CLARC from the Gaithersburg campus to the U.S. Army 
installation at Fort Ritchie, Maryland. This provides additional resources and 
access for historians and scientists employed by the FTAA.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1986</b> - President Ronald Reagan further tasks FTAA (in cooperation with 
partner organizations) with monitoring research and development of temporal 
technologies by international actors, as well as developing technology to extend 
the sphere of influence of the American people beyond the current temporal era. 
This strengthening of the mission supports protecting and defending temporal 
stability and American interests.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1988</b> - FTAA opens first cross-temporal diplomatic relationship, 
establishing the United States' first temporal embassy. Over the following 
three years, two more temporal embassies are established.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1992</b> - Rogue reverse temporal incursion event in Mid-Atlantic region 
creates greater awareness of the FTAA's work and leads to major alterations in 
FTAA operating policies and proceedures. The Office of Public Communication opens 
new office and visitor center in Emmitsburg, MD to help educate the public on 
the work of the FTAA.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Current FTAA Facilities</h3>
<p><ul>
<li><b>National Chronographic Laboratory and Research Center (CLARC)</b> - Fort Ritchie, MD
<br>Home of core operations and research activities for the agency, including 
anomaly detection and correction, technical systems controls, and general 
historical research activies. Also serves as the home of the FTAA's caesium 
beam clock, sister unit and backup for the NIST-7 clock in Boulder, Colorado. 
This clock achieves an uncertainty of 5 x 10-15, or 20 times more accurate 
than pervious models.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>NIST Campus Satellite Research Center</b> - Gaithersburg, MD
<br>Located in the original historic home of the agency, the FTAA's research 
center on the NIST campus serves as a shared and cooperative working space 
for joint operations with a variety of federal and non-federal partners.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Western Chronographic Laboratory</b> - Livermore, CA
<br>In cooperation with the University of California, Berkeley and the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory, the FTAA maintains a west coast research incubator 
to help further methods and practices both in the technological systems 
surrounding temporal investigation but also historical research.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Main FTAA Headquarters</b> - Herbert C. Hoover Building, Washington, D.C.
<br>Location of the agency's senior leadership and central service offices, 
including shared services with Department of Commerce.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>FTAA Visitor Center</b> - 317 South Seton Ave., Emmitsburg, MD
<br>Located on the campus of Saint Joseph College, this facility serves as 
the public face of the agency, hosting exhibits on agency activities, the 
history of temporal  technologies, and information for interested parties. 
This also serves as the FTAA's press office.
</li>
</ul>
