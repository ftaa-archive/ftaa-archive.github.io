<h3>Accomplishing the Mission</h3>
<p>
The Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority has worked dilligently for the American 
people for over 25 years keeping the American people safe and the timeline stable. 
This work is undertaken by the hard working men and women of the FTAA - scientists, 
researchers, technicians, historians, and policy experts. The backbone of the FTAA 
are the skilled teams that help maintain critical system and avoid significant 
disruption to the flow of time.
