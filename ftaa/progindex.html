<h3>The Mission of the FTAA</h3>
<p>
The mission of the Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority is defined in the FTAA 
Authorization Act of 1967 as follows:
</p><p>
<i>The Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority studies, monitors, and assists in 
intervention within temporal eras beyond the present to protect and defend the 
interests of the American people. The FTAA cooperates with partners to develop 
understanding of other eras and extend the influence of the current temporal 
era throughout the timeline.</i>

<h3>Major Events in the History of the FTAA</h3>
<p><ul>
<li><b>1967</b> - Congress authorizes the FTAA to be formed in a multi-agency 
cooperating agreement between National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, and the Lawrence Radiation 
Laboratory (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). The first FTAA offices 
are established on the campus of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in California.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1971</b> - National Bureau of Standards establishes an East Coast research 
hub on their Gaithersburg, MD campus. President Richard M. Nixon attends the 
groundbreaking of the main research facility building. This facility eventually 
becomes known as the National Chronographic Laboratory and Research Center (CLARC).
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1983</b> - In partnership with Department of Defense, the National Bureau 
of Standards moves the CLARC from the Gaithersburg campus to the U.S. Army 
installation at Fort Ritchie, Maryland. This provides additional resources and 
access for historians and scientists employed by the FTAA.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1988</b> - President Ronald Reagan further tasks FTAA (in cooperation with 
partner organizations) with monitoring research and development of temporal 
technologies by international actors, as well as controlling the import and 
export of materials from alternate temporal eras. This strengthening of the 
mission supports protecting and defending temporal stability and American 
interests.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>1992</b> - Rogue reverse temporal incursion event in Mid-Atlantic region 
creates greater awareness of the FTAA's work and leads to major alterations in 
FTAA operating policies and proceedures. The Office of Public Communication opens 
new office and visitor center in Emmitsburg, MD to help educate the public on 
the work of the FTAA.
</li>
</ul>
