</h1>
<p>
The U.S. Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority is a sub-agency of the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology operating in a bilateral agreement with
the U.S. Department of Defense. The FTAA leads temporal monitoring and defensive 
strategy for the United States Government and is responsible for implementing 
the President's temporal policies. The U.S. currently has cross-temporal diplomatic 
relations with three chronographic eras and maintains active information gathering 
operations in each. This WWW site is a cooperative initiative between the FTAA's 
Office of Public Communication and the Department of Computer and Machine Sciences at 
<a href="http://www.stjc.edu">St. Joseph's College</a> in Emmitsburg, MD.</p>
<p>
The FTAA is staffed by a dedicated corps of professionals who work to keep Americans and this temporal era safe and secure each day. You may use the links below to learn more about the history of the agency and our current operations. FTAA employees may access sensitive information in the data storage area.</p>
