<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">This website was recovered from a series of 3&frac12; inch floppy disks <a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://youtu.be/MPu4mHMEZJU" target="_blank">collected from an abandoned government building</a>. They were left by a former employee of the FTAA in a box, apparently for me to recover. I know that sounds odd. But the last year has been a little odd. I've uploaded the files here as I found them - they were in a zip archive spanned across a bunch of discs.</span></p>

<br/><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">About The Archive:</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">I&rsquo;m an historian who loves writing about local stories. In Spring 2022, <a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwuaz_sHVf_YHhTF8oF8P03CS4OBrZCMb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I began digitizing a series of VHS tapes I found at a local charity used book sale</a>. When I find rare documents I immediately try to puzzle through what they tell me - do that research around them and figure out the bigger context. Then I can tell the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">That first set of VHS tapes was vexing - I couldn't find any reference to them or the events they talked about. They described some sort of Federal agency that monitored time travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Those first tapes led a local man to gift me a second collection from his late wife - a series of <a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwuaz_sHVf_aSX4sQLiryt032j9Y059h7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VHS tapes</a>, documents, and artifacts that also came from this obscure government agency - the Federal Temporal Anomaly Authority.</span></p>
